Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.
Note: You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.

class Solution:
    def sort012(self, arr):
        low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(arr) - 1

        while mid <= high:
            if arr[mid] == 0:
                arr[low], arr[mid] = arr[mid], arr[low]
                low += 1
                mid += 1
            elif arr[mid] == 1:
                mid += 1
            else:  # arr[mid] == 2
                arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]
                high -= 1
        
        return arr
